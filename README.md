= Austin Swing Syndicate Elections Application =

== Description ==

This app is designed to allow members of the Austin Swing Syndicate to vote for 
members of the Austin Swing Syndicate Board. It was designed to be really
simple. 

== Use ==

=== Admin ===
An admin user can create 1 or more positions. Each position can be assigned a
number of possible winners. For example, a member gets to vote for 3 at-large 
members.

After adding positions, candidates can be added to the various positions.

The only other admin function is viewing the results.

=== Voting ===

Each voter should be given a unique id to vote with. These IDs can be used to 
maps votes to voters. 

On the voting page, the vote inputs their id. They are then presented with 
a list of positions and candidates. They can select up to the specified number
of candidates for each position.

== Possible Future Improvements ==

* Add bios and photos to voting page.
* Randomize the order in which the candidates appear on the voting page. 
  This would eliminate any unfair advantage to a candidate appearing first.
